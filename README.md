This repo contains the projects related to :
1) calculating Disparity - Calculating disparity in a Python computer vision project involves determining the horizontal shift of corresponding points between stereo image pairs captured by left and right cameras. The process includes rectifying the images, matching pixels using stereo algorithms, measuring the horizontal shift, and creating a disparity map. This map represents the relative depth of objects, with brighter regions indicating closer objects and darker regions indicating farther objects. Disparity calculation is crucial for applications like 3D scene reconstruction, object detection, and scene understanding in fields such as robotics, autonomous driving, and augmented reality. It provides valuable insights into the scene's spatial layout, enabling advanced computer vision tasks and applications.
2) 2) Real time face tracking - Real-time face tracking in a Python CV project involves using the OpenCV library to detect and track human faces in a live video stream. By implementing techniques like face detection and tracking, this application can accurately identify and follow faces as they move within the video. This project has applications in areas such as surveillance, human-computer interaction, and entertainment, enabling tasks like face recognition and emotion detection in real-time scenarios.
3) Face and lip detection - Face and lip detection in a Python CV project involves using image processing and machine learning algorithms to locate and extract faces and lips from images or videos. By leveraging libraries like OpenCV and pre-trained models, developers can create applications for tasks such as facial recognition, emotion detection, lip reading, and speech analysis, enabling various applications in biometrics, surveillance, and human-computer interaction.
